# Numerical analysis

These documents are course notes and computations to accompany Math 3210 Numerical Analysis at Dalhousie University, Winter 2023.

Course textbook: 

TA Driscoll and RJ Braun (2022) Fundamentals of Numerical Computation, Julia Edition. [Website](https://tobydriscoll.net/fnc-julia/home.html).

You can view the Jupyter notebooks on line by clicking the links below. I suggest you download the Julia examples to your computer so you can use them interactively.

You can get files in several ways from this github site:

* Download the latest version of all files by clicking "code" then selecting "download as zip file"
* Download a single file by clicking the link or the file name, then choosing "Raw" and saving the jupyter notebook (ipynb) file opened in your browser.
* If you have used git before (or want to learn), [clone](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) the repository to your computer, then use "git pull" to keep the files up to date. You may need to install software on your computer ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Mac](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)) to make git available on your own machine.
