# Numerical analysis

These documents are course notes and computations to accompany Math 3210 Numerical Analysis at Dalhousie University, Winter 2023.

You can view the Jupyter notebooks on line by clicking the links below. I suggest you download the Julia examples to your computer so you can use them interactively.
