# Numerical analysis

These documents are course notes and computations to accompany Math 3210 Numerical Analysis at Dalhousie University, Winter 2023.

Course textbook: 

TA Driscoll and RJ Braun (2022) Fundamentals of Numerical Computation, Julia Edition. [Website](https://tobydriscoll.net/fnc-julia/home.html).

You can view the Jupyter notebooks on line by clicking the links below. I suggest you download the Julia examples to your computer so you can use them interactively.
