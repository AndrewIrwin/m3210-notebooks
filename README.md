# Numerical analysis

These documents are course notes and computations to accompany Math 3210 Numerical Analysis at Dalhousie University, Winter 2023.

Course textbook: 

TA Driscoll and RJ Braun (2022) Fundamentals of Numerical Computation, Julia Edition. [Website](https://tobydriscoll.net/fnc-julia/home.html).

You can view the Jupyter notebooks on line by clicking the links below. I suggest you download the Julia examples to your computer so you can use them interactively.

You can get files in several ways from this github site:

* Download the latest version of all files by clicking "Code" then selecting "Download zip"
* Download a single file by clicking the link or the file name, then choosing "Raw" and saving the jupyter notebook (ipynb) file opened in your browser. ([Detailed instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-download-single-files-from-a-github-repository/), or click the "D" link below.) The file extension on your computer should be ipynb, but your computer may add ".txt". If it adds that, use File explorer or Finder to remove the .txt.
* If you have used git before (or want to learn), [clone](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) the repository to your computer, then use "git pull" to keep the files up to date. You may need to install software on your computer ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Mac](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)) to make git available on your own machine.
