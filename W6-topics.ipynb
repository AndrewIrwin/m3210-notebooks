    "[Chapter 5](https://tobydriscoll.net/fnc-julia/localapprox/overview.html) Piecewise interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already talked about a few ways to approximate data with functions: linear and non-linear regression. For linear regression, a polynomial can be used to approximate data. If the degree of the polynomial is one less than the number of data points, the \"regression\" will interpolate the data. Generally we don't want polynomial interpolation because the curve will oscillate wildly between points unless we are very lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we look a piecewise linear and cubic interpolation. The function will be composed of many linear or cubic pieces connected together through data."

If the nodes $x_i$ are equally spaced ($x_{i+1}-x_i = h$) then the the largest distance between the source function $f$ and its interpolant $p$ is bounded by $Mh^2$ where $M = \\|f''\\|_\\infty$. As long as the second derivative is bounded, the important part is that the error decreases quadratically with $h$. If you increase the number of node by a factor of 2, then the error decreases by a factor of 4."
