# Using Visual Studio Code

During week 2 I will demonstrate how to use Visual Studio Code to work with Julia.

Here are the steps to get set up

* Download and install Visual Studio Code [from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Launch VS Code
* Install the Julia "extension"
  * Open the extensions manager by clicking on the four boxes icon, or select menu View > Extensions
  * Type julia in the search box
  * Click install on the "Julia / Julia language support" box.
* Open the folder on your computer that has the file "W2-julia.jmd" from the course website on [github](https://github.com/AndrewIrwin/m3210-notebooks).
* A list of files should appear on the left. Click on "W2-julia.jmd" to open it.

Just like in Jupyter notebooks, you can send computer code to Julia by hitting shift-enter when the cursor is on a particular line. In 
Jupyter notebooks this evaluates a whole block of code, but in VS Code, only the line your cursor is on (or the set of lines you have highlighted) is evalated.

I will demonstate this in class.
